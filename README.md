NYC_airbnb_project
==============================

Airbnb is very popular choose among people on travelling. This project uses New York City's airbnb data, which contains almost 50 thousand airbnb listings in NYC, trying to explore the relationship between rentals price and their locations, between rentals availability and their locations and so on. I tried to use some visualization methods to demonstrate their relationships. And I also built some different regression models to predict the price of NYC Airbnb rentals and evaluate these models performences, according to their different features.
